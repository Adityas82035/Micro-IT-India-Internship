Tic Tac Toe is a classic 2-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two users to take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid, with logic to detect winning conditions or a draw.
üïπÔ∏è Features:
- Interactive 3x3 game board
- Real-time win/draw detection
- Clean and responsive UI
- Reset functionality to play again
This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and implement game logic from scratch using core JavaScript.
